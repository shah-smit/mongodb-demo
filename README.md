* Date

**Slide 2: Introduction**

* Briefly explain the current data storage solution using Apache Druid.
* Mention the challenges faced with Apache Druid (e.g., complex setup, limited schema flexibility).
* Introduce MongoDB as a potential alternative offering improved performance and flexibility.

**Slide 3: Apache Druid - Strengths and Weaknesses**

* Strengths:
    * High-performance for real-time analytics and aggregations.
    * Scalable for large datasets.
* Weaknesses:
    * Complex setup and maintenance.
    * Limited schema flexibility (less ideal for evolving data).
    * Can be resource-intensive for smaller datasets. 

**Slide 4: MongoDB - Strengths and Weaknesses**

Strengths:
Flexible document model for diverse data structures.
Easier setup and management compared to Druid.
Well-suited for ad-hoc queries and data exploration.
Optimized for time series data with built-in time series collections.
Integrates seamlessly with Spring Boot applications.
Supports efficient data import and export (including S3).
Weaknesses:
May not achieve the same real-time performance as Druid for specific workloads.
Requires careful schema design for optimal querying.

**Slide 5: Cost Comparison (Placeholder - Fill in details)**

* Briefly discuss the estimated costs associated with each solution. 
* Consider factors like:
    * Licensing fees (if applicable)
    * Hardware/infrastructure requirements
    * Management overhead

**Slide 6: Spring Boot Integration**

* Highlight the ease of integration between MongoDB and Spring Boot applications.
* Mention Spring Data MongoDB for simplified data access and repository management.

**Slide 7: S3 Import and Export**

* Emphasize MongoDB's ability to import and export data directly to/from S3 storage.
* This simplifies data archiving, backups, and disaster recovery processes.

**Slide 8: Conclusion**

Summarize the key benefits of transitioning to MongoDB, including the advantages of MongoDB Time Series Collections:
Improved flexibility for evolving data structures.
Easier data management and reduced complexity.
Seamless integration with existing Spring Boot environment.
Efficient S3 integration for archiving and disaster recovery.
Optimized storage and query performance for time series data.
Propose a migration plan and timeline for a smooth transition.

**Slide 9: Next Steps**

* Open the floor for discussion and address any concerns.
* Outline next steps for further evaluation and potential pilot implementation.

**Additional Notes:**

* Tailor the content to your company's specific needs and challenges. 
* You can add visuals (charts, graphs) to enhance the presentation.
* Emphasize the cost benefits if MongoDB offers a more cost-effective solution.
